    "My final project is about the massive divide in Name, Image, and likeness (NIL) earnings and spending both amoungst the players and confernces themselves.I used a data set that gave accurate evaluations for the top 100 college football players. From this data set, I created a Lorenz curve that was about to show the extreme inequality in NIL earnings. The Lorenz curve showed that a small percentage of players were earning the majority of NIL money, with another graphic showing that the top 4 players made the small as the bottom 60. Although we were only able to look at the top 100, my reserch only lead me to beleive that the ineqaulity just gets wore as you go down the list beyond those players. I also looked at the conference level spending with NIL which proved the pwoer conferences spend over 10 times more on NIL than the smaller conferences. Overall, my final project is meant to show people that the college football landsacape is being completely reshapred by NIL, with the benefits being concentrated in the hands of a few elite players and programs."
